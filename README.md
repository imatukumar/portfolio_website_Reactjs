# In this repository, the node_modules folder is not included. This is intentional because all required dependencies are listed in the package.json file.

To install the necessary dependencies, navigate to the project folder and run the following command:

 npm install


Read the package.json file.
Download and install all required dependencies into the node_modules folder.
After running npm install, youâ€™ll have all the packages needed to run the project.
